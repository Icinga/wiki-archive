# Plugin Collections

## General
In the wild, there are various websites collecting plugins, addons, bundles, etc

**Info:** Use and update [Icinga Exchange](https://exchange.icinga.org)!

Content may differ, as the first one was renamed from nagiosexchange to monitoringexchange due to trademark issues, while the second one is the official hosted by Nagios Inc. All Nagios plugins should be compatible to Icinga (with slight adaptions in case), so feel free to use all available sources.


### Other valid sources
