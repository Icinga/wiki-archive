## PLUGINS:

### check_puppetdb_dups:
This check reports the percent of catalogs and resources that are duplicated. It doesn't accept thresholds as it's mainly informational. The information will probably not be useful in the short term, but will be interesting to trend over time.

### check_puppetdb_memory:
This check reports on Java's heap memory usage. It accepts warning and critical thresholds expressed as percents of the maximum allowed usage.

### check_puppetdb_populations:
This check reports on resource and node populations. It generates a total of three graphs: average resources per node, node count, and resource count (only showing the average resources per node graph):

### check_puppetdb_processed:
This check reports on how many commands have been processed by PuppetDB.

### check_puppetdb_queue:
This plugin reports on PuppetDB's internal command queue depth. It's currently using the default pnp4nagios template as it's a simple parameter to plot. The example image below shows what happens when you stop Postgres for a while... the commands back up in the queue, then get processed as soon as Postgres is started. For the size of my site, I expect this to hover around 0. Your site may be different, so be prepared to tune the thresholds.

## INSTALLATION:
Copy the plugins out of the plugins directory and put them into Nagios' plugins directory on the Nagios server (this is usually /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins on a 64-bit RHEL/CentOS box).

Copy the pnp4nagios templates out of the pnp4nagios/templates directory and put them into pnp4nagios' templates directory (On EL6 using the pnp4nagios package from EPEL, this directory is /usr/share/nagios/html/pnp4nagios/templates).

Copy the pnp4nagios check commands configs out of the pnp4nagios/check_commands directory and put them in pnp4nagios' check_commands directory. Using the same package from EPEL as above, this is /etc/pnp4nagios/check_commands. Do this BEFORE configuring the service checks in Nagios otherwise the RRD's will get created with the wrong data types (To fix this, just delete the .rrd files and start over).

## NAGIOS CONFIGURATION:
Decide if you are going to access PuppetDB via the default plain text http port (8080) or if you are going to front that with apache/nginx and terminate ssl with that server. The plugins were not designed to access PuppetDB's ssl on port 8081. The command definitions below assume that you are accessing PuppetDB via a webserver running with ssl enabled on port 443 and then proxy-passing that traffic to PuppetDB on port 8080 on localhost.

If you are proxy-passing the traffic and you have authentication turned on, you will want to allow your Nagios host access without authentication (or modify the plugins to accept/use a username and password). For Apache, this can be accomplished with an 'Allow' directive combined with 'Satisfy any' where you are configuring your authentication.
