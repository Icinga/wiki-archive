#IRC Community Guidelines

##One Rule to Rule Them All
Icinga is a friendly, community driven project and the Freenode IRC network is one of the ways we communicate with others in real time.

We’d like to keep it that way, so please remember; if you treat others with respect and courtesy, they will respect you and treat you with courtesy in return. In fact, rather than write out a bunch of stuffy rules in a bullet list for the obvious things, we like to keep our rules simple...

##OUR RULES:
###Rule #1
*Keep it friendly and clean or keep it to yourself.*
 
...and we leave the rest to our list of un-written rules which, like the rules above themselves, are enforced at the discretion of the ops. [ As we all know, sometimes an f-bomb can be appropriate and/or eloquently put ;) ] That said, anything that would get you or us in trouble with Freenode or the PDPC will be handled swiftly.

###Speaking of language...

Icinga is multi-national, with contributors and users hailing from many countries across the globe. In order to avoid a ‘[Tower of Babel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel)’ effect, the preferred language on our IRC channels is English. However, sometimes when no one else is looking, or a particular idea is just too hard to express in anything other than someone’s native tongue you might find that there are several pages of German appear in your buffer. Don't be alarmed.

If you happen to see others discussing something and you don’t understand the language they are using, politely let them know that you’d like to be included in the conversation. They’ll be glad to switch back to English for you.

If you happen upon such a conversation late, you can always use [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) to get the gist of what was said... or at least have a good laugh at the result. You could also ask someone for a quick summary of what was said.

##Guidelines
While we only have the one rule outlined above, we do have some guidelines which will help you to follow that rule.

These guidelines do not cover every single aspect of proper channel etiquette, so when in doubt try being friendly and polite. Being nice, cooperative and respectful is not just appreciated, it's expected.

###When asking questions, please try to be specific

 When you are asking for help, it is often hard to answer your questions if you haven't mentioned which UI it is you are talking about or what version you are running. So beginning a query with something like "I'm running Icinga 2.3.4 with Icinga Web2 and need to do X." goes a long way towards getting someone to respond, because no one likes to feel like they have to drag information from the person asking the question.
 
Of course, there are some more general questions that don't need this kind of information so you'll have to use a little bit of judgement.

##Don't flood the channel

Flooding the channel is disruptive, annoying and is considered unfriendly behavior. Please don't do it. If you need/want to share a large amount of text, such as your logs, configs or a list of errors which are some of the things often requested, please use [Pastie](http://pastie.org/) or [Pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com) or another service like them.

##Don't cross post your question(s)

**`#icinga`** is the support channel for end user help. All of the developers who are currently on IRC and are available to help you with end user support will be in this channel. This includes some great third party add-on developers, not just the Icinga Team.

**`#icinga-devel`** is for Icinga related development. If you are not a developer and ask an end user question in a **`#icinga-devel`** expect to be asked to take it to **`#icinga`** or to be ignored. If you persist and it is deemed disruptive or you do it frequently then you will be removed from the development channel.

There are reasons for having separate channels, not the least of which is that sometimes the developers need to focus while still being available to one another. And we really do like to keep them productive. Posting your end user question to **`#icinga-devel`** is considered both off-topic and rude because you aren't respecting the wishes of those in the channel, so expect this to be enforced.

##Timing your questions

The developers and community users are spread out across the globe. The time of day when you ask a question will influence who reads the question. People may not have an answer to your question right away, so please try to be patient.

If you don't get a response immediately, please wait a little while before asking again. If you've asked a few times an no one has answered; don't get mad. The reason for that is because no one who is around knows the answer.

Lastly, don't forget, it is worth considering the icinga-users Mailing List if you have not tried it already. ( See [Support Info](https://www.icinga.org/support/) )

##Don't be annoying

There are many ways to be annoying. Personal attacks when things don't go as planned, other attention-seeking behavior, and continued misbehaving after you have been advised to stop is both disruptive and obnoxious. Such behavior may result in a removal from the channel and the more egregious it is the less likely you will be warned ahead of time.

##Don't harass or incite harassment

Do not organize or encourage harassment of any  person or group of people, or take part in any such activity, or continue doing something after someone points that you are out of line. Please note that this is also strongly discouraged in Freenode policy ( [Freenode about Offtopic](https://freenode.net/policy.shtml#offtopic) ), and may result in being barred from not just our channels, but the Freenode IRC network as well.

##When helping: be helpful

**`#icinga`** welcomes your help, but we do ask you to try to be as helpful as possible. If you get stuck, say so instead of guessing at answers and passing them off as something more than that. So at the very least, please be up front about the fact that you are using your vivid imagination rather than providing actual facts and knowledge. If you need more information to answer a question, don't be afraid to ask them for it. There are also heaps of information available on the wiki, in the docs and in many other places. Be sure to use them and to point them out where appropriate since they are often more descriptive than a brief IRC chat can be.

Icinga is under constant development, so try to avoid giving outdated information to someone who is using a newer release or vice-versa. Also, try to avoid giving out wrong information such as things that are specific to Nagios, but do not apply to Icinga.
While we encourage everyone to offer Icinga support to other users, the channel operators will try to ensure that the advice given is sound and safe, and they will use their best judgement to ensure that the channel as a whole follows the recommendations of developers, and the Icinga Team.

##Don't ask for operator privileges

Don't ask us, we will ask you. Being an operator in #icinga is not a privilege, it is a responsibility.

##Please don't bring bots

Sanctioned bots will be provided if there is a need for them.
The current list of approved bots is in the Tools section of the [IRC wiki page](03_00_irc.md).
